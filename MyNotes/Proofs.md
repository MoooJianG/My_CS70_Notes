## What is proofs
A proof is a finite sequence of steps, called logical deductions, which establishes the truth of a desired statement.
# 2. Notation and basic facts
# 3. Direct Proof
***Direct Proof***
1. Goal: To prove $P\implies Q$
2. Approach: Assume P
3. ......
4. Therefore Q

# 4. Proof by Contraposition 
***Proof  by Contraposition***
1. Goal: To prove $P\implies Q$ 
2. Approach: $\neg Q$ 
3. ...
4. Therefore $\neg P$ 
5. Conclusion: $\neg Q \implies \neg P$, which is equivalent to $P \implies Q$

# 5. Proof by Contradiction
***Proof by  Contradiction***
1. Goal: To prove P
2. Appoach: Assume $\neg P$
3. ...
4. R
5. ...
6. $\neg R$
7. Conclusion: $\neg P \implies \neg R \land R$, which is a contradiction. Thus P.
